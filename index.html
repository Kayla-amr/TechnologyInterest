    <h4>I'm most excited to learn about...</h4>
    <div class="react">
      <h5>React</h5>
      <p>The things I am most excited to learn about in this class is 1. JavaScript, it's one of the most useful codes and I hope to understand it and be able to gain this skill 2. CSS, In Fall 2019 I took the course DGM2120 and I liked the idea of coding HTML and CSS so I hope to learn more through this course 3. how to overall continue practicing coding to keep gaining experience. I was originally majoring in Computer Science but I feel Wed Design Development is more suited for me and more exciting to learn. I still don't know what or where I can use this degree but I hope to find that out soon by just continuing in taking courses and completing the degree.</p>
